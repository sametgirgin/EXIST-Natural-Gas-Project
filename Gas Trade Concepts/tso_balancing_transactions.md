In plain language, a TSO is the company responsible for operating the high-pressure gas transmission network — the big pipelines that move natural gas across regions or countries.

Think of the gas world as a layered system:

- Producers / importers → bring gas into the system
- TSO → transports gas through the backbone network
- DSO (Distribution System Operator) → delivers gas locally
- Shippers / traders / suppliers → use the network commercially

#### What a TSO Actually Does

A TSO is not (usually) selling gas as a merchant. It’s more like the infrastructure guardian + traffic controller.

Core responsibilities:
- Operate and maintain transmission pipelines
- Ensure system pressure and stability
- Balance supply and demand (linepack management)
- Manage capacity (entry/exit booking)
- Facilitate gas nominations and scheduling
- Perform balancing actions when needed
- Provide transparency to the market

##### Real-World Examples
To give you a sense of who these organizations are:
- In Türkiye: BOTAŞ operates as the TSO for the national gas grid.
- In Germany: Companies like Open Grid Europe (OGE) or Gasunie.
- In the UK: National Grid.

##### TSO vs. DSO
It is helpful to distinguish them from the DSO (Distribution System Operator):
- TSO: Manages the "Highways" (Long distance, high pressure, connects countries/regions).
- DSO: Manages the "Local Streets" (Delivers gas directly to your home or office at low pressure).


### 1. Coded Transaction (Code 1)
A Coded Transaction is a specific type of trade executed by the TSO on a gas exchange or balancing platform. When you see "Code 1," it typically refers to Additional Balancer Operations.

- The Goal: To eliminate a physical imbalance in the network.
- The Mechanism: If the system is "short" (not enough gas), the TSO buys gas; if it is "long" (too much gas), the TSO sells gas.
- Why the "Code"? The use of a specific code (like Code 1) allows market participants and regulators to distinguish between standard commercial trades and those strictly intended for system integrity. It signals that the TSO is acting as the "residual balancer" because the market participants failed to balance their own positions.

### 2. Announcement for TSO Transactions
This refers to the formal Transparency Requirement and communication flow between the TSO and the market.

- The Purpose: The TSO must notify all market participants (traders, suppliers, and industrial consumers) about the balancing actions it has taken or is about to take.
- Market Impact: These announcements are crucial because TSO transactions often set the Marginal Price. If the TSO has to buy gas at a high price to fix an imbalance, that high price often becomes the penalty rate charged to the companies that caused the imbalance.
- Content: The announcement typically includes the volume of gas traded, the price, and the direction (buy/sell). This ensures the market remains fair and that the TSO's actions are predictable and auditable.
