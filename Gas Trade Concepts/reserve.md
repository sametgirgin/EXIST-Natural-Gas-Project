In the world of natural gas logistics, think of the transmission network not just as a set of pipes, but as a dynamic balancing act. As an expert in gas trading and grid operations, I look at these "Reservations" as the contractual backbone that ensures the system doesn't over-pressurize or run dry.

Here is the breakdown of these concepts within the context of a Transmission System Operator (TSO) framework:

### Reserve (Capacity Reservation)

In gas transmission, "Reserve" refers to Capacity Reservation. Unlike a warehouse where you reserve physical space, in a pipeline, you are reserving the right to move a specific volume of energy (usually measured in $Sm^3$ or $kWh$) through a specific point during a defined period (daily, monthly, or yearly).
- The "Ship-or-Pay" Principle: Usually, when a trader "reserves" capacity, they pay for it regardless of whether they actually flow gas.
- Why it matters: The TSO uses these reservations to ensure the physical integrity of the grid. If the total reservations exceed the pipeline's diameter and pressure capabilities, the system faces a bottleneck.

### Entry Amount (Input to the Grid)
This is the "Injection" phase. The Entry Amount represents the volume of gas that Shippers (traders/producers) are scheduled to feed into the main transmission high-pressure grid.
- Sources: This typically includes gas coming from international import pipelines, LNG terminal regasification units, underground storage withdrawals, or domestic production fields.
- The Reservation Program: The TSO looks at all the "Entry Nominations." If a company has reserved 1,000,000 m^3 of entry capacity at a border point, their "Entry Amount" in the program reflects how much of that reservation they intend to actually use that day.

### Exit Amount (Off-take from the Grid)
This is the "Consumption" or "Delivery" phase. The Exit Amount is the volume of gas scheduled to leave the high-pressure transmission network to reach the end-user.

- Destinations: Gas usually exits the transmission grid into:
    - Distribution Networks: For residential and commercial heating.
    - Large Industrial Consumers: Such as cement factories or chemical plants.
    - Gas-Fired Power Plants: For electricity generation.
    - Storage Injection: Pumping gas back into underground mines/aquifers.
    - Export Points: Sending gas to a neighboring country's grid.

- The Reservation Program: This tells the TSO where the "sink" is. If the Exit Amount significantly exceeds the Entry Amount, line pack (pressure) drops, and the TSO must step in to balance the system.

### Why the "Reservation Program" is Critical
In markets like those governed by ENTSOG (Europe) or EPİAŞ (Turkey), these two figures allow the TSO to calculate the System Balance.

- Entry Amount - Exit Amount = Delta (Line Pack)
- Surplus: If Entries > Exits, pressure rises.
- Deficit: If Exits > Entries, pressure falls.

Traders watch these numbers closely because if their actual flow deviates from their reserved/nominated amounts, they face Imbalance Charges, which can be quite expensive.
