These totals include all sessions (day-ahead, intraday, day-behind) for daily contracts plus the weekly contract trades.

### SGP Daily Trade Volume (By Segment)
This metric breaks down the financial turnover of the market based on when the trade occurred relative to the Gas Day ($D$).

| Contract / Segment | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **Day Ahead Transaction Volume (TL)** | Trades matched on day **D − 1** for delivery on day **D**. This is the primary "planning" phase of the market. |
| **Intraday Transaction Volume (TL)** | Trades matched on day **D** for delivery on the same day. This is used for real-time balancing and reacting to sudden demand shifts. |
| **Day After Transaction Volume (TL)** | In some reporting frameworks, this covers late-clearing adjustments or specific "balancing gas" transactions that occur immediately following the gas day. |
| **Total (TL)** | The vertical sum of the three categories above for a specific Gas Day. |

### GRP Trade Volume
- GRP stands for Gas Reference Price (or Gaz Referans Fiyatı - GRF). This is a specific financial metric used for settlement and imbalance penalties.
- Gas Day: The specific 24-hour period (starting at 08:00 and ending at 08:00 the following day) to which the price and volume apply.
- DRP Trade Volume (TL): This is the monetary value of the trades that specifically qualify for the calculation of the Day-Ahead Reference Price.

Note: Not all trades are included in the DRP calculation. Usually, only standard "Day-Ahead" matches from the "Daily" contract segment are used to ensure the price reflects a stable market benchmark.
