## Spot Natural Gas Market: Mechanics, Drivers, and Participants

In energy trading, the **spot gas market** represents the “here and now.” While long-term contracts (often 10–20 years) historically dominated the industry, the spot market has become the central mechanism for **global price discovery**.

### 1. What Exactly Is “Spot” Gas?

In the spot market, natural gas is bought and sold for **immediate or near-term delivery**. Unlike forward contracts (price agreed today for delivery next year), spot trades typically settle within **24 hours to one month**.

- **Day-Ahead (DA):**  
  The most common form of spot trade. Gas is purchased today for delivery tomorrow.

- **Within-Day (WD):**  
  Trading for delivery on the same day to manage sudden demand shifts (e.g., power plant outages or unexpected weather changes).

- **Physical Exchange:**  
  Spot trades are primarily **physical**. Purchasing 10,000 MMBtu implies actual gas flow through pipelines or LNG unloading.

### 2. The Infrastructure: Trading Hubs

Spot trading occurs at **hubs**—geographic or virtual points where multiple pipelines intersect.

- **Henry Hub (USA – Louisiana):**  
  Benchmark for North America and widely referenced in global LNG pricing.

- **TTF (Title Transfer Facility) – Netherlands:**  
  Europe’s most liquid hub and the global benchmark for non-US gas.

- **NBP (National Balancing Point) – UK:**  
  The oldest virtual gas hub in Europe.

- **JKM (Japan Korea Marker) – Asia-Pacific:**  
  A price assessment (not a physical hub) reflecting spot LNG cargo prices in North Asia.

### 3. What Drives Spot Prices?

Spot markets are highly **volatile**, with prices capable of swinging dramatically based on short-term dynamics.

- **Weather:**  
  Extreme cold, heatwaves, or low renewable generation (e.g., *dunkelflaute* in Germany) can trigger price spikes.

- **Storage Levels:**  
  Inventories below the 5-year average increase scarcity concerns and elevate prices.

- **Infrastructure Bottlenecks:**  
  Pipeline outages, explosions, or maintenance events can restrict supply and cause regional price divergence.

- **LNG Arbitrage:**  
  Price spreads between regions (e.g., TTF vs. JKM) influence LNG cargo destination decisions.

---

### 4. Why Use the Spot Market?

- **Balancing:**  
  Utilities manage mismatches between contracted supply and actual consumption.

- **Price Discovery:**  
  Spot prices establish fair market value benchmarks.

- **Arbitrage:**  
  Traders exploit price differences between hubs when transport capacity allows.

- **Reference Pricing:**  
  Modern long-term contracts increasingly link to spot hub indices rather than oil products.

### 5. Pricing Mechanism: Gas-on-Gas Competition

Spot prices emerge from **gas-on-gas competition** within markets characterized by many buyers and sellers.

- **Volatility:**  
  Prices react instantly to supply-demand shifts.

- **Determinants:**  
  Influenced by temperature, holidays, renewable output, storage levels, and global LNG supply.

- **Correlation:**  
  In liquid markets (e.g., Europe), hub prices are highly correlated, minimizing spreads.

---

### 6. Market Participants

- **Physical Players:**  
  Producers, utilities, importers, local distribution companies.

- **Financial Players:**  
  Banks and hedge funds trading for hedging or speculation.

- **Shippers:**  
  Entities reserving pipeline capacity to move gas.

---

### 7. Geopolitical Impact

Spot markets are extremely sensitive to geopolitical developments.

For example, modeling of a potential **EU ban on Russian gas** suggests that:

- TTF spot prices could rise by approximately **$0.27/MMBtu** (average between 2028–2035).
- Markets would adjust via substitution (e.g., increased US LNG imports).

This highlights the spot market’s role as a **real-time scarcity signal**.
