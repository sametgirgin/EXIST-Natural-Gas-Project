In the natural gas market, Retroactive Adjustment is a common financial reconciliation process. Since gas trading involves physical flow, complex metering, and various price indexes, the initial invoice is often based on "best available data" rather than "final perfect data."

#### Why do Retroactive Adjustments happen?
In a perfect world, every meter would be read instantly and accurately. In reality, several factors cause discrepancies that are only discovered weeks or months later:
- Measurement Errors: A physical meter at a distribution point might be found to have been calibrated incorrectly, requiring a recalculation of volumes for the past six months.
- Data Corrections: A Distribution Company (GAZDAŞ, İGDAŞ, etc.) might update the consumption data of a large industrial consumer after a manual inspection.
- Price Revisions: If a component of the gas price (like a regulated tariff or a specific index) is retroactively changed by the regulator (EPDK), all previous trades using that price must be recalculated.
- System Errors: Technical glitches in the transmission or settlement software that led to incorrect cost allocations.

#### Credit vs. Payable (The Financial Impact)
The "Retroactive Adjustment Item Amount" is the net sum of these corrections. It can move in two directions:
- Credit Amount (Receivable): If the correction shows that you were overcharged in the past (e.g., you paid for 100 units but actually only used 95), EPİAŞ will credit this amount to your new invoice, reducing your current total payment.
- Payable Amount (Debt): If the correction shows you were undercharged (e.g., you used more gas than recorded), this amount is added to your current invoice as a debt you must pay.

#### The "New Invoice" Logic
Instead of EPİAŞ canceling old invoices and reissuing them (which would be an accounting nightmare for thousands of participants), they simply bundle the difference into the current billing cycle. > Example: > Your February 2026 gas usage is $10,000.
    However, a correction from November 2025 shows you overpaid by $500. Your Retroactive Adjustment Item will show as a -$500 Credit, and your final February invoice total will be $9,500.

#### Why Traders Must Monitor This
For a portfolio manager or a finance officer in a gas company, this item is a source of "Settlement Risk."
- Margin Impact: Large retroactive adjustments can suddenly turn a profitable month into a loss (or vice versa).
- Cash Flow: Because these adjustments are unpredictable, companies must maintain a cash buffer to handle sudden "Payable" amounts that appear without warning.
