In the fast-paced world of gas trading, "Actualization" is the moment of truth. While we spend all day "nominating" (scheduling) what we intend to do, actualization is the shift from paper dreams to physical reality.

As a gas trader, I look at these figures to determine my Imbalance Position. If what I scheduled doesn't match what actually happened, I’m either long or short on gas, and that costs money.

### Actualization (Physical Flow)
In the energy markets, Actualization is the process of reconciling forecasted nominations with the physical gas that actually moved through the meter.

Think of it like a bank statement. Your "Pending" transactions are nominations; your "Cleared" transactions are the actualized amounts. Because gas is a physical commodity affected by pipe pressure, compressor failures, or temperature changes, the number we say we will move and the number the TSO measures are rarely identical.

### Actual Entry Amount (The "Buy" Side)

From a trader's perspective, the Actual Entry Amount is the physical verification of your purchase transactions.
- The Source: This is the gas you’ve successfully injected into the high-pressure grid from an import point (like a border pipeline), an LNG terminal, or a storage facility.
- The Transaction: If I bought 10,000 MWh of gas from an international supplier, the "Actual Entry" is what the TSO's meter at the border station recorded.
- Operational Risk: If there is a technical glitch at the upstream production field, my Actual Entry might be lower than my reservation. I am now "Short" gas and must buy it on the intraday market to avoid penalties.

### Actual Exit Amount (The "Sell" Side)
The Actual Exit Amount is the physical verification of your sales transactions or your customers' consumption.
- The Destination: This is the gas leaving the transmission system to go to a power plant, a local distribution zone (homes), or an industrial buyer.
- The Transaction: This represents the fulfillment of your sale. If I sold gas to a factory, the Actual Exit is what their meter showed they consumed that day.
- Market Impact: If a sudden warm front hits and people turn down their heaters, the Actual Exit will be lower than expected. I am now "Long" gas, meaning I have leftover gas in the system that I might have to sell off quickly at a lower price.

### Why this matters to you (EPİAŞ / STP context)

On a platform like EPİAŞ (the Turkish energy exchange), these actualized values are used to settle the Day-Ahead and Intraday markets. If you are a Shipper, you are constantly monitoring the gap between your "Reservation Program" (the plan) and the "Actualization" (the reality) to minimize your exposure to high imbalance costs.
