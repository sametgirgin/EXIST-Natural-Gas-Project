### Physical Realization (Natural Gas)
This refers to the actual flow of gas at physical entry and exit points. When a Shipper "adds or removes" gas here, they are interacting with the infrastructure—pipes, storage facilities, or LNG terminals.

- Buying/Entry: Gas flowing into the network from a production field, an interconnecting pipeline from another country, or an LNG regasification plant.
- Selling/Exit: Gas leaving the network to supply a power plant, a large industrial consumer, or a local distribution company (LDC).
- Key Characteristic: It represents the "hard" assets and the physical reality of the grid. If a shipper buys 100 units physically, 100 units must physically enter a specific valve or meter.

### Virtual Realization (Natural Gas)
This occurs at the Virtual Trading Point (VTP or UDN). It represents the commercial exchange of gas ownership without the need for the gas to move to a specific physical location.

- The Hub Concept: Shippers can trade gas that is already "in the system." If Shipper A sells to Shipper B at the UDN, the gas stays in the pipes, but the title changes hands.
- Flexibility: This allows for a liquid wholesale market. Shippers use virtual realization to balance their portfolios without worrying about specific pipeline capacities at physical nodes.
- Net Impact: While "virtual," these trades still count toward a shipper's daily balance. If you sell more virtually than you bring in physically, you are "short" on gas.

### System Balance (Natural Gas)
The System Balance is the "health check" of the entire transmission network. For a pipeline to function safely and efficiently, it must operate within a specific pressure range, known as the Linepack (Network Stock).
- Target vs. Actual: The Transmission System Operator (TSO) sets a target for how much gas should be sitting in the pipes to keep pressures stable.
- Positive (+) Balance: This indicates Surplus. More gas was injected into the system than withdrawn. If the stock is too high, the TSO may need to sell gas or restrict injections to prevent over-pressurization.
- Negative (-) Balance: This indicates Deficit. More gas was withdrawn than injected. If the stock falls too low, the TSO must buy "balancing gas" or use its own reserves to prevent a drop in pressure that could cut off consumers.

**NOTE**: In most regulatory regimes, if your individual "Shipper Balance" contributes to a negative "System Balance," you will face imbalance charges. The TSO uses these charges to incentivize shippers to keep their inputs and outputs as close to equal as possible.

Physical realization → affects actual pressures & flows
Virtual realization → affects commercial exposure & imbalance risk
System balance → measures operator’s comfort level

A shipper can be:
- Physically balanced but commercially off
- Virtually balanced but physically disruptive
- Or perfectly aligned (rare, like a unicorn wearing PPE)
