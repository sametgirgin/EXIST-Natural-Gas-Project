### What is the Gas Future Market (GFM)?

The GFM is an organized marketplace for trading standardized contracts for natural gas. Unlike the "Spot" market (where you buy gas for tomorrow), the GFM allows you to buy or sell gas for delivery months or even years in the advance. Its primary goal is hedging: protecting a business from the volatility of gas prices.

A futures contract is a legally binding agreement specifying:
- Delivery period (daily, monthly, quarterly, seasonal)
- Contract quantity (e.g., 1,000 Sm³/day)
- Delivery point (hub, entry/exit zone, virtual trading point)
- Price (fixed or indexed)

Unlike spot trading, futures trading primarily manages price risk rather than immediate physical delivery.

### Breaking Down the Key Concepts

#### GFM Daily Index Price
This is the benchmark price for the day. It is a volume-weighted average of all trades made during that session. Traders use this to understand the "fair market value" of gas for a specific future period (e.g., March 2026).

##### GFM Matching Amount ($1000.Sm^3/day$)
The Unit: $1000.Sm^3$ stands for "Thousand Standard Cubic Meters."The Meaning: This represents the total quantity of gas that has successfully been "matched" between buyers and sellers for a specific delivery day. If you see a high matching amount, it means the market is active and buyers/sellers are finding common ground on price.

#### GFM Trade Volume
While "Matching Amount" looks at the physical quantity, Trade Volume usually refers to the monetary value of those trades (e.g., in Lira or Dollars) or the total number of contracts exchanged. It shows the "liquidity" of the market—how much money is moving through it.

#### GFM Transaction History
This is the "tape" or the log of every trade that has occurred. It shows the price, quantity, and time of each transaction. Professional traders analyze this to see if the market is trending up (bullish) or down (bearish).

#### GFM Contract Price Summary
GFM deals in different "products" (Monthly, Quarterly, or Yearly). This summary shows you a bird's-eye view of the prices for these different timeframes. For example:
- Q1 Contract: Price for delivery in Jan-Feb-March.
- Monthly Contract: Price for delivery in the next immediate month.

#### GFM Open Position ($1000.Sm^3/day$)
This is a critical risk metric. An Open Position is a contract that has been bought or sold but has not yet been "closed out" by an opposing trade or fulfilled by physical delivery.
- High Open Interest/Position means there is a lot of "skin in the game" and many participants are waiting for future delivery.

#### GFM Order Prices
These are the "live" bids (buyers) and asks (sellers) currently waiting in the system. They haven't turned into a trade yet.
- Bid: The maximum price a buyer is willing to pay.
- Ask: The minimum price a seller is willing to accept.
