As a gas trader, you can think of the transmission network as a massive highway system. To drive on it, you don't just need a car (the gas) and a destination (the contract); you also need a permit to use the lane at a specific time.

In natural gas markets, capacity is permission, not gas.

- Owning gas without capacity is like owning water with no pipe.
- Owning capacity without gas is like reserving a pipe with nothing to send.

In the gas world, that permit is Capacity. Here is how it works from a trading and operations perspective:

### Capacity: 
In the simplest terms, Capacity is the right to flow a specific volume of natural gas through a point in the network during a defined period (hourly, daily, or yearly).
- The "Pipe" Reality: Pipelines have physical limits based on diameter and pressure. The TSO (Transmission System Operator) sells "Capacity Rights" to traders.
- Book it or Lose it: If you have 100,000 $m^3$ of gas to move but only 50,000 $m^3$ of booked capacity, you cannot nominate the full amount. You are physically "capped."Firm vs. Interruptible: 
- Firm Capacity: Guaranteed by the TSO (unless there is an emergency).
    - Interruptible Capacity: Cheaper, but the TSO can "cut" your flow if the network gets too crowded.

Capacity is the contractual right to use the transmission system:
- At a specific point (entry / exit / storage / interconnection)
- For a defined quantity
- Over a defined period (yearly, quarterly, monthly, daily, intraday)

It is sold by the Transmission System Operator (TSO).
- Gas flows obey physics
- Capacity rights obey contracts

### Max Entry Amount
This is the ceiling for how much gas can physically enter the grid at a specific point (like a border crossing or an LNG terminal) based on the TSO's technical plan.
- Trader's View: Even if you have a contract to buy a massive amount of gas from a neighboring country, you are restricted by this number. It is the "Input Limit" of the grid's hardware.
- Operational Planning: The TSO calculates this based on compressor station power and the current pressure inside the main trunklines. If the pipes are already "full" (high pressure), the Max Entry Amount for that day might decrease.
- The Constraint: If the total nominations from all traders exceed the Max Entry Amount, the TSO will scale back (pro-rata) everyone’s flows.

### Max Exit Amount
This is the ceiling for how much gas can be taken out of the grid at a specific delivery point (like a power plant connection or a city gate).
- Trader's View: This is critical when you are supplying a large industrial client. If your client wants to increase production and needs more gas, you must first check if the Max Exit Amount at their specific location allows for that extra flow.
- Pressure Management: To get gas out of the pipe, there must be enough "push" (pressure) behind it. If too many people try to exit at the same spot simultaneously, the pressure drops too low, which is why the TSO sets this maximum limit to protect the equipment.

### The Trader’s "Golden Rule"
As a trader, your daily job is a three-way puzzle:
- Commodity: Do I have the gas?
- Capacity: Do I have the legal right to move it?
- Network Limits: Does the Max Entry/Exit Amount allow the physics of the move to actually happen?
