## Transport Nomination
In the world of natural gas logistics, Nomination is the fundamental communication mechanism between a network user (like a trader or a power plant operator) and the Transmission System Operator (TSO).

Think of it as a formal "reservation" or "intent to use" the pipeline. Because gas flows physically according to pressure and physics, but is traded commercially on paper, nominations ensure the two worlds stay balanced.

A Transport Nomination is the formal request submitted by a shipper (capacity holder) to a Transmission System Operator (TSO) specifying:
- How much gas will flow
- During which gas day (usually 06:00–06:00)
- From which entry point
- To which exit point

Think of it as a logistics instruction for molecules.

Without it:

- Pipelines can’t schedule flows
- Balancing systems can’t function
- Imbalances and penalties start lurking like accounting gremlins

It is both a commercial declaration and an operational scheduling too

A Transport Nomination is the overarching request made by a balance group lead or a trader to move a specific quantity of energy (measured in kWh or m^3) through the high-pressure grid over a specific period (usually a gas day or an hour).
- The Purpose: It tells the TSO how much capacity you intend to use so they can manage grid pressure and ensure the system doesn't "choke" or lose pressure.
- The Matching Process: If you nominate to move gas from Point A to Point B, the TSO checks if the counterparty at Point A is actually delivering that gas. This is known as the Matching Process.

### Entry Nomination
An Entry Nomination represents the physical injection of gas into the transmission system. This is the "start" of the journey within a specific market area.
- Physical Points: These typically include Cross-Border Interconnection Points (IPs), LNG terminals, domestic production fields, or Underground Storage (UGS) facilities.
- The Flow: It indicates the quantity of gas entering the grid from an external source.
- Expert Insight: In most European entry-exit systems (like the German THE or Turkish EPİAŞ), you must have "Entry Capacity" booked before you can submit an Entry Nomination.

### Exit Nomination
An Exit Nomination represents the physical withdrawal of gas from the transmission system to be delivered to a downstream destination.
- Physical Points: These are usually delivery points to Large Industrial Consumers (e.g., a steel mill), Gas-Fired Power Plants, Distribution Networks (for residential heating), or export points to neighboring countries.
- The Flow: It indicates the quantity of gas leaving the high-pressure grid.
- The Balancing Act: For a portfolio to be "balanced," your total Entry Nominations must equal your total Exit Nominations (plus or minus any changes in storage or imbalances).

### Why this matters for a Gas Trader

If your nominations are inaccurate, you face Imbalance Charges. If you nominate 100 units at Entry but your customer only takes 80 units at Exit, you have left 20 units in the pipe. Depending on the market rules (like those on the EPİAŞ platform), the TSO will charge you a penalty for this discrepancy to cover the cost of balancing the system.
