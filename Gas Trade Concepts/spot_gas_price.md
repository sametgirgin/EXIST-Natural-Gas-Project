### Spot Gas Market Price

The Spot Price refers to the current market value for natural gas intended for immediate or near-term delivery. In gas trading, "spot" typically encompasses two main products:
- Same day (within-day)
- Next day (day-ahead)


The price at which a specific volume of gas is traded on an exchange (like ICE Endex or EEX) or over-the-counter (OTC) for delivery on the same day or the following day.

It reflects real-time fundamentals:
weather shifts, storage levels, LNG flows, outages, pipeline constraints.

Think of it as:
- “What did traders just agree gas is worth right now?”

It’s formed directly by bids/offers on exchanges (like EEX or ICE) or OTC trades.

Typical references: ICE Endex, EEX, CME, Platts, Argus.



### Spot Gas Market Daily Reference Price: 

This is a calculated benchmark, often used to value contracts or settle imbalances when a single "market price" isn't sufficient.
- Also known as the Weighted Average Price (WAP), it is the volume-weighted average of all trades executed on a specific trading hub (like the TTF in the Netherlands or NBP in the UK) for a single gas day.
- It prevents a single "spike" trade from skewing the market's perceived value, providing a fair representative price for that day's activity.



### Spot Gas Market Balancing Gas Price
This is a "punitive" or "incentive" price used by the Transmission System Operator (TSO) to settle differences between what a trader nominated (promised) and what they actually delivered/consumed.
- It consists of two prices: the Marginal Buy Price (if you are short on gas) and the Marginal Sell Price (if you have excess gas).
- During tight systems, balancing prices may explode above spot prices.

Mechanism:
- Marginal Buy Price: Usually the higher of the highest trade price that day or the Daily Reference Price + a small premium (e.g., 10%).
- Marginal Sell Price: Usually the lower of the lowest trade price that day or the Daily Reference Price - a small discount.
- Purpose: To encourage traders to balance their own portfolios rather than relying on the TSO to fix their imbalances.


### Spot Gas Weekly Reference Price
While less common as a regulatory term than the daily price, the Weekly Reference Price is a critical commercial and analytical benchmark.
- The arithmetic or volume-weighted average of the Daily Reference Prices over a 7-day period (Monday–Sunday).
- Used by industrial consumers and retailers to smooth out daily volatility. Many "Gas-to-Gas" indexed contracts use weekly or monthly averages to determine the final invoice price for end-users.
Used for:
- Weekly indexation contracts
- Trend analysis
- Portfolio valuation
